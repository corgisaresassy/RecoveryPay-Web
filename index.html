                    <!-- I ultimately want to include a link here to a diagram of a statement -->
                    Your statement was generated using the information provided by your treatment provider. Within the statement you will find:
                    <ul class="sublist">
                        <li><p>The name, address and phone number of your rendering provider</p></li>
                        <li><p>The services provided by your rendering provider</p></li>
                        <li><p>The amounts paid by your insurance company for these services</p></li>
                        <li><p>The amounts remaining which you owe, these are typically composed of your deductible, co-pay, or co-insurance</p></li>

                <div class="columnof3"> 
                    <h3 class="columnheader">Why Do I Have To Pay?</h3>
                    As part of your insurance coverage, you are responsible for paying for services until your deductible is met, paying any co-pays associated with your service and any co-insurance amounts. Without these your insurance company would not typically offer coverage at all.
                    <br><br>
                    Our goal is to help your treatment provider contact you about these amounts and receive payment as required by law. If you are unable to pay today, please contact your facility directly to discuss a payment plan.
